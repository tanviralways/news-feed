    <h3>1. Difference between var let const?</h3>
    <p>
      = The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let
      variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. It
      can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Difference between arrow function and regular function?</h3>
    <p>
      = Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this .
      The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the
      lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the
      closest non-arrow parent function.
    </p>
    <h3>What is difference between map and forEach and filter?</h3>
    <p>
      = The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given
      array. The map() method creates an entirely new array. The forEach()
      method returns “undefined“. The map() method returns the newly created
      array according to the provided callback function.
    </p>
    <h3>What are template strings used for?</h3>
    <p>
      = Template literals (template strings) allow you to use strings or
      embedded expressions in the form of a string. They are enclosed in
      backticks `` . For example, const name = 'Jack'; console.
